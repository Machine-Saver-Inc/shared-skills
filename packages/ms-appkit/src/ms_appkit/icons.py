"""The mark on a button, from Lucide.

Every icon in every Machine Saver program comes from **Lucide** (https://lucide.dev) - the set
shadcn/ui is built on - vendored into `resources/icons/` from `lucide-static`
and licensed ISC. Hand-drawn glyphs were tried first and two of them shipped
illegible at 16px; a maintained set drawn on one grid by people who do this for
a living is a better default than anything drawn here in an afternoon.

The file name is the name a button asks for, so an application never mentions
a Lucide name: `icon("back")`, not `icon("arrow-left")`. That indirection is
what lets the mark for an idea change without touching every screen.

Every mark is stroked in `currentColor`, which is substituted for the colour of
the text beside it - a fixed-colour icon is invisible on a machine set to dark.
