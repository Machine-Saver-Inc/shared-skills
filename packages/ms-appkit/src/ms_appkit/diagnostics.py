"""What to tell us when something goes wrong.

Gathers the facts that actually shorten a diagnosis -- version, platform, which
screen was open, and whatever context the program itself adds -- and
turns them into a filled-in issue on this program's own repository.

Deliberately free of Qt so the report can be built and tested without a window,
and so what gets posted is inspectable rather than assembled inside a dialog.

The repository is public, so paths under the user's home directory are reduced
to ``~`` before anything is shown or posted.
