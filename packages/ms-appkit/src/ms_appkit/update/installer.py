"""Downloading and applying an update.

The same three routes in every Machine Saver program: a Windows installer runs
and the program restarts, an AppImage replaces itself in place, and a .deb is
downloaded for the user to install because no program of ours asks for root.

Kept free of Qt so the download, the checksum check and the decision about how
to install can be tested without a running application.

Nothing here runs while the program is in the middle of something it should
not be interrupted during; the caller enforces that.
