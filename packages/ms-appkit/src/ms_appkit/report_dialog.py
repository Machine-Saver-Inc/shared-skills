"""The report-a-problem dialog, the same in every Machine Saver program.

An employee who has reported a problem from one of these tools has reported a
problem from all of them: the button is in the same corner, the dialog asks the
same two questions, and the preview shows exactly what will be posted before
anything leaves the machine -- because the repository is public and the report
carries details of this computer.
